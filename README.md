### Static Hosting with GitHub Pages

> **Note**  
> You can find the workflow to use for your own project [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/is-cute/suri/master/.github/workflows/main.yml).

Copy the [source repository](https://github.com/jstayton/suri) and create a workflow file under `.github/workflows/build.yml`. This will be the file used by GitHub Actions to compile your new build whenever changes are made.

Your website should be deployed from the `gh-pages` branch.

### Managing Links

Links are managed through `src/links.json`. An example config can be found below or in the [source repo](https://github.com/jstayton/suri/blob/master/src/links.json).

```json
{
  "/": "https://github.com/is-cute",
  "/bocchi": "https://bocchi.is-cute.moe",
  "/localhost": "http://127.0.0.1"
}
```

> **Note**  
> In this example, `yourdomain.com/` would take you to [https://github.com/is-cute](https://github.com/is-cute), while `yourdomain.com/localhost` would take you to [http://127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1).
